## Architecture

### Workflow Execution Engine
The application features a sophisticated workflow execution engine that handles:
- **Task Registry**: Dynamic loading and validation of all task types
- **Execution Context**: Isolated execution environments for each workflow run
- **Credit Tracking**: Real-time credit consumption monitoring
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms and graceful error handling
- **Progress Tracking**: Live execution progress updates

### Data Flow
1. **Workflow Definition**: Users create workflows using the visual editor
2. **Validation**: Workflows are validated for completeness and credit requirements
3. **Execution**: Tasks are executed sequentially with data passing between them
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time execution monitoring with detailed logging
5. **Results**: Data is delivered through configured output channels

## Workflow System

### Visual Workflow Editor

## Scheduling & Automation

### Hybrid Scheduling System
To overcome platform limitations, Scrape Flow implements a unique hybrid scheduling approach:

#### Vercel Cron Integration
- Daily cron job configured in `vercel.json`
- Serves as a backup execution trigger
- Ensures workflows are checked at least once daily

#### Browser-Based Local Cron
- Client-side component running in user browsers
- Polls `/api/workflows/cron` endpoint at configurable intervals
- Works in both development and production environments
- Configurable polling frequency (default: 60 seconds)

### Schedule Types

#### Simple Intervals
- **Seconds**: `30s` (every 30 seconds)
- **Minutes**: `5m` (every 5 minutes)
- **Hours**: `2h` (every 2 hours)
- **Days**: `1d` (daily)

#### Cron Expressions
- **Standard Cron**: `0 9 * * 1-5` (weekdays at 9am)
- **Complex Patterns**: `*/15 * * * *` (every 15 minutes)
- **Custom Schedules**: Full cron expression support

### Resilience Features
- **Exponential Backoff**: Automatic retry with increasing delays
- **Cache Prevention**: Timestamp-based cache busting
- **Error Recovery**: Continues operation during temporary failures
- **Resource Optimization**: Minimal API calls when browser is inactive

## Credit System & Billing

### Credit-Based Usage
- **Transparent Pricing**: Each task type has a defined credit cost
- **Pre-execution Validation**: Workflows validate credit requirements before running
- **Real-time Tracking**: Live credit consumption monitoring
- **Usage Analytics**: Detailed breakdown of credit usage by task type

### Billing Integration
- **Stripe Integration**: Secure payment processing
